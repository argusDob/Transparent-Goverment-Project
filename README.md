# Transparent-Goverment-Project

I have created a web app displaying Congressional data from the ProPublica Congress API on an HTML page. 
Specifically, I have create two pages, one for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives. Javascript create two tables
and i have apply filters to be more usefull for the end user

There are several steps to complete task:

I get an API key for the ProPublica Congress API
I get the JSON objects for the two chambers of Congress and I saved them in files
I have created HTML pages that use JavaScript to display the JSON data in tabular form, and CSS(Bootsrap) to format the tables nicely

In particular, many questions come up when comparing how the members of each party vote. 
Some simple statistics gathered and displayed in a nice readable table on web pages for the Senate and the House.
I have created dables that present some data and statistics:

the number of Democrats, Republicans and Independents

how Democrats and Republicans compare, on average, for voting with their party

which members most often do not vote with their party, which ones most often do vote with their party

which members have missed the most votes, which have missed the least
